Primary Source for [[Zinc]]

Proccessed in a following way:
- Calcinate in a [[Rotary Kiln]] to get Zinc Oxide
- Dissolve [[Metal Oxide]] in [[Sulfuric Acid]] to get Zinc Sulfide Slurry
- Run Slurry through [[Crystallizer]] to get Zinc Crystals
- Melt Crystals into ingots
OR
- Smelt in a blast furnace to obtain [[Zinc]] ingots in a less effecient (2/3 of potential yeild)
