A more advanced version of the [[Gravity Separator]], The Trommel has the ability to recover rarer materials from [[Dirty Crushed Ore]] and can recover common metals from **sand** and **gravel**.

You can occasionally use this machine to extract metals from [[Slag]], such as the case with the Chromium Thermite [[Slag]] 

The machine requires **power** and **water** to function.
